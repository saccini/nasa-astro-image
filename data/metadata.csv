2025-06-17,Rosette Nebula Deep Field,RosettaDeepRed_Mendez_960.jpg,"Explanation:  
Can you find the Rosette Nebula?

The red flowery-looking nebula 
just above the image center 
may seem a good choice, but that's not it. 

The famous Rosette Nebula 
is really located on the lower right, here 
colored blue and white, 
and connected to the 
other nebulas by gold-colored filaments. 

Because the 
featured image of Rosette's field is so 
wide, and because of its deep 
red 
exposure, it seems to contain other flowers. 

Designated NGC 2237, 
the center of the Rosette Nebula is populated 
by the bright blue stars of open cluster 
NGC 2244, 
whose winds and 
energetic light are evacuating the nebula's center. 

The Rosette Nebula is about 5,000 light years distant and, just by itself, 
spans about three times the diameter of a 
full moon.

This flowery field can be found toward the 
constellation of the 
Unicorn  
(Monoceros).
